Description:

Raytracer is a program that simulates the process of ray tracing to create realistic images. It utilizes basic principles of optics to render light and shadows in a scene consisting of geometric shapes such as spheres, planes, and other primitives.

Key Components:

    Scene Geometry: Implementation of various geometric shapes such as spheres, planes, and triangles that will be present in the scene.

    Ray Tracing: An algorithm that traces rays of light from the camera into the scene and determines which objects they intersect along their path. This process involves calculating the closest intersection of a ray with a scene object.

    Lighting: Modeling the lighting of the scene, including ambient lighting, diffuse lighting, and specular highlights.

    Shadows: Determining shadows cast by objects in the scene that block light from light sources to points on the surface of other objects.

    Materials: Implementation of different types of materials for objects, such as reflective, diffuse, and transparent materials.

Additional Features:

    Reflections: Implementation of ray reflections, allowing objects to reflect light and the surrounding environment.

    Refractions: Modeling the refraction of rays through transparent surfaces such as glass or water.
